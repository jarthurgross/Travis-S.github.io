Things I work on in my spare time.

<i class="fa fa-file-code-o"></i> [qcircuit](http://github.com/CQuIC-GitHub/qcircuit)
> Originally developed by Steve Flammia and Bryan Eastin, I am working on helping qcircuit be more accessible by the quantum information community. I would like to work to make qcircuit more easily useable, as well as updating the software for other TeX drawing packages.

<i class="fa fa-file-code-o"></i> [CQuIC@GitHub](https://cquic-github.github.io/)
> Along with other students in CQuIC, I am working on developing a site for showcasing some of the work done by members of our group. We hope to enable others to use tools and workflows developed for/by GitHub users and get more and better work accomplished.

Research Interests
==========

** Quantum Information Theory and Statistical Inference
> Right now, I am mostly thinking about the use of _model selection_ criteria to assist experimentalists in the construction of quantum information processing devices. Much of this revolves around the problem of trying to determine what is actually inside the black box the experimentalist builds. In a related vein, I am keen to learn how to apply tools of statistical inference to other such problems. Along the way, I have been learning how to program in Python for the purposes of numerical investigations.

> John Wheeler's famous saying "The it from the bit" has struck a cord in my thought processes. Can we really use information theory (classical and quantum) to say something meaningful about the physical world around us? Or are we playing with a 'chicken and egg' type problem here?

** Finance and Economics
> I have a keen interest in monetary theory and policy. It is absurd to me that I can go to my bank and use its services all the while not knowning what is going on 'behind the curtain'. In particular, I am interested in understanding how fiat currencies enable economic growth, and would like to understand if a system can be established in which the economy reaches a steady-state value for various economic metrics, and whether such a state is fundamentally incompatible with fiat currency.

** Technology and Science
> I have taken to reading works on technology, society, and "the future", and am looking for some perspective on why information theory/complexity theory should have anything to do with human progress. Or, to express my sentiments more accurately, I would like to understand how we can leverage technology in ways which substantially transform human interaction; currently, I see most innovation as piecemeal construction of a new thing from already existing parts. How new parts could be built, and what those parts should do, is something I would like to learn more about.

My research currently takes place through the [Center for Quantum Information and Control](http://www.cquic.org) at the <a href="http://www.unm.edu" target="_blank">University of New Mexico</a>. Funding for my work is provided by <a href="http://www.sandia.gov" target="_blank">Sandia National Laboratories</a>.<br/><br/> 

As far as problems are concerned, I have been thinking about quantum information and computation. In fact, I think this subject is probably the only one I have given any consideration to whatsoever, although finance and economics ought to be mentioned.<br/><br/>

#Informal Description#
Recently (22 May 2014), I used the <a href="http://splasho.com/upgoer5" target="_blank">Up-Goer 5</a> web application to help me describe my research using only the 1000 most common words in the English language. I have posted a copy of that text below:<br/><br/>

In my work, I think about computers. But not just any type of computer. It is a very small computer. How small? Really small. Smaller than your phone, and smaller than the pieces in your phone. Since they are so small, they are hard to work with. Just think if you had to build a tiny computer!<br/><br/>

These tiny computers can be built, but it is very hard. Many times, the people who work to build these computers - let's call them "computer people" - can't even see the computer they are building...which makes it hard to know what is going on inside. Most of the time though, we can learn something about these computers if we think a lot.<br/><br/>

So what do I think about when I think about these computers? I try to think of new things we could give the computer people to help them out. Usually, these things are new ways of figuring out what is going on inside the tiny computer. Sometimes, the computer people are really glad for my help, and sometimes not. How do I do this? I usually think a lot about these computers and the problems they have. Sometimes I think I have a really good idea, but then see it does not work so well. Other times, the idea is a good one, and I write some words to show the idea, and how the computer people could use the idea to help themselves. Most of the time, I write a lot, think a lot, and use my own computer to look up new things. Sometimes, I do checks on my own computer to help me see if my idea is good.<br/><br/>

My work is very fun, and I enjoy it a lot. I get to work with really bright people in a nice building, and from time to time, I go places to meet other bright people, where we talk about our good (and bad!) ideas.<br/><br/>

A more formal description:<br/><br/>

Right now, I am mostly thinking about the use of <em>model selection</em> criteria to assist experimentalists in the construction of quantum information processing devices. Much of this revolves around the problem of trying to determine what is actually inside the black box the experimentalist builds. In a related vein, I am keen to learn how to apply tools of statistical inference to other such problems. Along the way, I have been learning how to program in Python for the purposes of numerical investigations. <br/><br/>

Additionally, John Wheeler's famous saying "The it from the bit" has struck a cord in my thought processes. Can we really use information theory (classical and quantum) to say something meaningful about the physical world around us? Or are we playing with a 'chicken and egg' type problem here?<br/><br/>

Along those lines, I have taken to reading works on technology, society, and "the future", and am looking for some perspective on why information theory/complexity theory should have anything to do with human progress. Or, to express my sentiments more accurately, I would like to understand how we can leverage technology in ways which substantially transform human interaction; currently, I see most innovation as piecemeal construction of a new thing from already existing parts. How new parts could be built, and what those parts should do, is something I would like to learn more about.
<br/><br/>

Outside of physics, I have a keen interest in monetary theory and policy. It is absurd to me that I can go to my bank and use its services all the while not knowning what is going on 'behind the curtain'. In particular, I am interested in understanding how fiat currencies enable economic growth, and would like to understand if a system can be established in which the economy reaches a steady-state value for various economic metrics, and whether such a state is fundamentally incompatible with fiat currency. <br/><br/>

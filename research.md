My research currently takes place through the [Center for Quantum Information and Control](http://www.cquic.org) at the [University of New Mexico](http://www.unm.edu). Funding for my work is provided by [Sandia National Laboratories](http://www.sandia.gov).

As far as problems are concerned, I have been thinking about quantum information and computation. In fact, I think this subject is probably the only one I have given any consideration to whatsoever, although finance and economics ought to be mentioned.

Recently (22 May 2014), I used the [Up-Goer 5](http://splasho.com/upgoer5) web application to help me describe my research using only the 1000 most common words in the English language. I have posted a copy of that text below:

<blockquote>

*Disclaimer*: Instead of ''computer'', I really should have used ''information processor''. I am _not_ thinking about problems related to full-fledged quantum computation.

**A more formal description of my work**:

Right now, I am mostly thinking about the use of _model selection_ criteria to assist experimentalists in the construction of quantum information processing devices. Much of this revolves around the problem of trying to determine what is actually inside the black box the experimentalist builds. In a related vein, I am keen to learn how to apply tools of statistical inference to other such problems. Along the way, I have been learning how to program in Python for the purposes of numerical investigations.

Additionally, John Wheeler's famous saying "The it from the bit" has struck a cord in my thought processes. Can we really use information theory (classical and quantum) to say something meaningful about the physical world around us? Or are we playing with a 'chicken and egg' type problem here?

Along those lines, I have taken to reading works on technology, society, and "the future", and am looking for some perspective on why information theory/complexity theory should have anything to do with human progress. Or, to express my sentiments more accurately, I would like to understand how we can leverage technology in ways which substantially transform human interaction; currently, I see most innovation as piecemeal construction of a new thing from already existing parts. How new parts could be built, and what those parts should do, is something I would like to learn more about.

Outside of physics, I have a keen interest in monetary theory and policy. It is absurd to me that I can go to my bank and use its services all the while not knowning what is going on 'behind the curtain'. In particular, I am interested in understanding how fiat currencies enable economic growth, and would like to understand if a system can be established in which the economy reaches a steady-state value for various economic metrics, and whether such a state is fundamentally incompatible with fiat currency.

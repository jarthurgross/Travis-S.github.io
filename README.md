My personal [website](http://www.unm.edu/~tscholten).

The point of this site is to get some practice using Jekyll for blogging purposes, as well as understanding how to code in HTML/CSS. The site eventually will look similar to a good web 2.0 project. Moreover, I would like to learn how to integrate Python code into the site for demonstration purposes.

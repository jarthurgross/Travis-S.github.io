Presentations
==============
Below is a list of some of the talks I have given. If possible, I have provided links to a screencast or video. At the very least I strive to provide a copy of the slide deck used.

> **Statistical Inference in Quantum Tomography: Uses of Hypothesis Testing and Information Criteria**

> Candidacy Exam for CQuIC at UNM [[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJ-bbFkgac) | [Slide Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuLKbIlGFIiWUt6c1czVnMxQ2V4djdNaDNEbHhCcmlqb29z/view?usp=sharing)]

> Quantum devices with ill-defined/unknown Hilbert space dimension pose problems for quantum tomography, as the size of the matrix to fit as an estimate needs to be determined. We may begin to address this problem using techniques from classical statistical inference. I will present an approach known as the likelihood ratio test and demonstrate an application to continuous-variable systems. This test relies on the null value of the test statistic - that is, the typical value when increasing the Hilbert space dimension provides no advantage to fitting the data. I will show preliminary numerical results indicating the null value is related to the dimension of the boundary of the Hilbert space, not its bulk dimension.

> **Spectral Gap Scaling of One-Dimensional Quantum Spin Chains**

> Caltech Perpall Speaking Competition:  [[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/spectral-gap-scaling-one-dimensional/id422627736?i=109862222&mt=2) [YouTube](http://youtu.be/cn7IW7qTBCs)

> A quantum computer built on adiabatic principles has an interesting runtime feature - the time it takes for the computation to execute depends on an 
energy gap within the system. It is not know whether an adiabatic quantum computer built out of spin 1/2 particles on 1 dimensional ring has energy gaps 
which close exponentially quickly in the system size. I present a way to investigate this problem numerically.

Posters

Below are links to various posters I have given. Available in pdf form.

2015 Southwestern Quantum Information and Technology Workshop

> [Lost in (Hilbert) Space - Model Selection for Quantum Tomography](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByuLKbIlGFIiejFnX1ZibHRIb1E&authuser=0)

> Reconstructing the quantum state of a continuous variable system (e.g., an optical mode) using quantum tomography presents a unique problem:  the dimension of its Hilbert space is infinite.  Its density matrix has infinitely many parameters, which cannot all be estimated from finite data.  Brute force reconstruction (e.g., via the Radon transform or deconvolution) produces undesirable overfitting artifacts.  Smoothing is one solution, but has no good theoretical justification. 

> I introduce a statistically well-motivated approach based on model selection and log likelihoods.  Maximum likelihood estimates in a sequence of D-dimensional subspaces (spanned by the first D Fock states) are ranked by their log likelihood. This ranking allows one to find an estimate whose dimension is smaller while simultaneously providing a good fit to data. I apply this method to heterodyne tomography and demonstrate the method can indeed eliminate overfitting by choosing a good dimension (D) in which to reconstruct optical states.

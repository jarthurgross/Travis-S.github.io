Presentations
==============
Below is a list of some of the talks I have given. If possible, I have provided links to a screencast or video. At the very least I strive to provide a copy of the slide deck used.

> **Statistical Inference in Quantum Tomography: Uses of Hypothesis Testing and Model Selection**

> Candidacy Exam for CQuIC at UNM [[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJ-bbFkgac) | [Slide Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuLKbIlGFIiWUt6c1czVnMxQ2V4djdNaDNEbHhCcmlqb29z/view?usp=sharing)]

> Experimentalists have done an excellent job building and controlling quantum systems. Their techniques are too good, however - they are capable of 
detecting errors for which we currently have no good theoretical models. I propose to use classical model selection techniques to help theorists build 
better models. As a toy example, I consider the problem of doing tomography on continuous variable systems and demonstrate model selection techniques 
could help.

> **Spectral Gap Scaling of One-Dimensional Quantum Spin Chains**

> Caltech Perpall Speaking Competition:  [[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/spectral-gap-scaling-one-dimensional/id422627736?i=109862222&mt=2) [YouTube](http://youtu.be/cn7IW7qTBCs)

> A quantum computer built on adiabatic principles has an interesting runtime feature - the time it takes for the computation to execute depends on an 
energy gap within the system. It is not know whether an adiabatic quantum computer built out of spin 1/2 particles on 1 dimensional ring has energy gaps 
which close exponentially quickly in the system size. I present a way to investigate this problem numerically.

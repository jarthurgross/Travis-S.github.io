Currently, I have been thinking alot on problems regarding quantum information and computation. In fact, I think this subject is probably the only one I have given any consideration to whatsoever, although finance and economics do need to be mentioned.
<br/><br/>
As of late, I have come to the viewpoint that an essential part of physics is to understand the idea of <em>distinguishability</em> of physical systems, and how this idea impacts what we can and should say about our knowledge of a physical system. A colloquial version of this idea is the phrase "If it smells like a rat, looks like a rat, it must be a...rat!". <br/><br/>
Additionally, John Wheeler's famous saying "The it from the bit" has struck a cord in my thought processes. Can we really use information theory (classical and quantum) to say something meaningful about the physical world around us? Or are we playing with a 'chicken and egg' type problem here?<br /><br />
Outside of physics, I have taken a keen interest in monetary theory and policy. It is absurd to me that I can go to my bank and use its services all the while not knowning what is going on 'behind the curtain'. So I would like to learn more. <br /><br /></p>

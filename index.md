Welcome to my home page. The point of this site, I suppose, is to serve as a central front for my online presence. Hence the social links above.

In the process of setting up this site, I have been learning how to write HTML and CSS code, as well as how to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to compile the site. I have put the source code for the site on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Travis-S).

Should you wish to provide feedback on my page, feel free to reach me via email. See my [CV](https://app.box.com/s/jqhua41jpw71cbmfic11) for contact info.

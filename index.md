Welcome to my home page. The point of this site, I suppose, is to serve as a central front for my online presence.

In the process of setting up this site, I have been learning how to write HTML and CSS code, as well as how to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to compile the site. I have put the source code for the site on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Travis-S).

Should you wish to provide feedback on my page, or show me know something cool to read, or just want to ask me about my work, feel free to reach me via email. Use the [contact](contact.html) page for the address.

A copy of my [CV](https://app.box.com/s/57tiv08uoem1aai2ow4f) is available in pdf form.

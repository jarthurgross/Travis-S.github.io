Welcome to my home page. This site contains some information about me, my research, and what I do. Please take a look around, and let me know if you have any questions.

Copies of my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuLKbIlGFIiYUdvSW9peXk1NDQ/view?usp=sharing)  and [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuLKbIlGFIiSURad1BnQm5pdDAyakVJakZBVnpYcnYzODFn/view?usp=sharing) are available in pdf form.

Should you want to check out some of my talks, please see my [Academics](academics.html) page or visit my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo1RVaq2aqTJMRZGzQa45WQ).

In the process of setting up this site, I have been learning how to write HTML and CSS code, as well as how to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to compile the site. I have put the source code for the site on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Travis-S).

Should you wish to provide feedback on my page, or show me know something cool to read, or just want to ask me about my work, feel free to reach me via email. Use the [contact](contact.html) page for the address.

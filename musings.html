As part of my undergraduate experience at Caltech, I did some <a href="http://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/strong-minds-healthy-bodies/" target="_blank">blogging</a> for the Admissions office. So perhaps there is still some part of me which wishes to improve my writing and communications skills. If anything, I am more apt to post content on my Google Plus <a href="http://www.google.com/+TScholten" target="_blank">Profile</a>.<br /><br />

During the first few years at Caltech, I wrote quite a bit of poetry. I have made a couple of collections available online. They are entitled <a href="https://app.box.com/s/c87krb40j0mlqirykpa6" target="blank">A Long Walk</a> and <a href="https://app.box.com/s/tctkl613kvn42uc9givp" target="blank">Summer Musings</a>.<br/><br/>

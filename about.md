#About Me#

*Ancient History*

Do we really need to go into that?

*Recent History*

I received my Bachelor's in Physics from Caltech in 2012, and then migrated to UNM to work on getting my Ph. D. My research currently takes place through 
the [Center for Quantum Information and Control](http://www.cquic.org) at the University of New Mexico. More specifically I am employed at Sandia 
National Laboratories where I work on problems related to quantum tomography.

#About the Site#
This site is the blend of a few frameworks for web development. I use <a href="http://purecss.io">PURECSS</a> to handle the CSS and site design. To manage 
the actual site content, I write up the pages in markdown and use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to output HTML pages. In order to keep the version(s) of 
the site correct, and thereby make it easy to make changes, I use [git](http://www.git-scm.com/). 

A special thank you is in order to [Elle Kasai](http://ellekasai.com/) who wrote the original [resumecards scripts](https://github.com/ellekasai/resumecards)
which I use on my [Resume](resume.html) page.

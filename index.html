Welcome to my home page. Frankly, what one is suppose to put on a personal/academic website such as this is beyond me. Also, most websites I visit for other academics do tend to be a bit bland (it's the truth!), so I endeavor to put some kind of creative effort into mine.
<br><br>
The point of this page, I suppose, is to serve as a central front from which my online identity can be managed. Hence the links to other online profiles in the side bar. <br/><br/>
In the process of setting up this site, I have been learning how to write HTML and CSS code, as well as how to use Jekyll to actually do the site building. (Turns out "blogging like a hacker" is easier than I thought!)

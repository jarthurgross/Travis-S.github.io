Welcome to my home page. The point of this site, I suppose, is to serve as a central front for my online presence. Hence the links to other online profiles in the side bar. <br/><br/>
In the process of setting up this site, I have been learning how to write HTML and CSS code, as well as how to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="blank">Jekyll</a> to compile the site. I have put the source code for the site on my GitHub page.
<br/><br/>
Should you wish to provide feedback on my page, feel free to reach me via email. See my <a href="https://app.box.com/s/l4qr7cmiixjvflub2l6t" target="_blank">CV</a> for contact info.

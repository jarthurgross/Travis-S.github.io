<h2> Home Page</h2>
<p>
Welcome to my home page. It is not much, I grant you. (Obviously it is still under construction!) Give it a bit of time. Any thoughts you may have about layout/color scheme would be appreciated, provided they are actually helpful. Frankly, what one is suppose to put on a personal/academic website such as this is beyond me. Also, most websites I visit for other academics do tend to be a bit bland (it's the truth!), so I endeavor to put some kind of creative effort into mine.
<br><br>
In the meanwhile, I have a page set up for the <a href="teaching.html">courses</a> I TA. That's the best place to get handouts, syllabi, extra credit problems, etc.
<br><br>
A recent addition to this site is a page describing my <a href="research.html">research</a>.
<br><br>
In a somewhat whimsical fashion, I've put up a page on which I may post various <a href="musings.html">musings</a> on subjects.
<br><br>
Following typical academic fashion, a copy of my <a href="{{site.url}}/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> is available. It contains academic history, research projects/papers, contact information, etc.

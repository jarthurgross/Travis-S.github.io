#Description#
This talk was presented at the inaugural US-China Young Physicists Forum, an event hosted by the American and Chinese Physical Societies. Given the focus was on condensed matter/materials science, I decided to discuss ideas related to quantum simulation.

#Abstract#
One of the great promises of quantum computation is to put the quantum world to work solving problems that are believed to be not efficiently tractable on a classical computer. It has been discovered that for some problems, such speedups are possible; the main bottleneck in using these speedups is the non-existence of a full-fledged quantum computer.  Efforts towards constructing one have been hindered by the delicate nature of quantum information - unwanted disturbances can lead to the computer crashing.

Consequently, there has been much work in developing techniques to build and control devices that, while not as computationally powerful as a quantum computer, can but used to solve simple yet interesting problems. These devices are known as quantum information processors (QIPs).  QIPs could provide a building block for a larger-scale quantum computer, performing a role analogous to arithmetic logical units in classical computers.

QIPs are built upon a diverse range of physical systems such as superconductors, atomic traps, or photonics. I will review some of the challenges involved in constructing QIPs and discuss their practical potential for changing the way we think of and build computers.

I suppose a better title might by ``Why I Program``. The truth of the matter, however, is that a physicist programming is fundamentally different than someone who majored in CS or a related field. Sort of like the difference between a Swiss army knife and a specialty one. You would probably never use the former in place of the latter, but it could do in a pinch. 

Likewise, programming a physicist is not always pretty, elegant, or thoughtful. But we try. Or at least, some of us do. I have been very lucky to know a bona fide Computer Engineering major here at UNM, and he has been extremely helpful in setting me straight. (Though sometimes I do not like it!)
